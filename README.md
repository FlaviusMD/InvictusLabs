## Description ##

The scope of this project is to construct a platform for measuring the credit risk of DeFi (lending) pools, by modelling the relationships between entities that partake in borrowing through causal inference and machine learning. 

For example, we can answer questions such as how the risk of a malicious borrower could ‘’intoxicate’’ others, via ripple effects.



## Benchmarks ##
* Expert-driven model
* Copula model
* Knowledge graph-based model

### Expert-driven model ###


### Copula model ###
- quantitative method for assesing credit risk
- use of a factor model based on joint multi-variate normal distribution properties

### Knowledge graph-based model ###
* Text to entity engine (using Transformer or Bidirectional LSTM architecture)
* Relationship modelling
* Quantify the impact of the relationship between entities
* Risk assesment engine
